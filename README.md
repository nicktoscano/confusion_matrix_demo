# Setting up confusion matrix demo with sklearn
I recently helped a customer with a sensitive project, which required a confusion matrix. For security reasons, I could not access the customer's data. Accessing the customer data is not necessary to complete the demo. It is more important to maintain data security. I just needed to understand the underlying features and structure of the data. 

Here is how I was able to quickly help the customer set up a confusion matrix demo using sklearn:

1. **Get Sample Data:** Extract the iris sample dataset for use. You do not need to export the iris dataset to a Pandas data frame. Exporting the dataset to Pandas made it easier for me to work with the data.
